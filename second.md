## Thinking Out Loud


I should probably be doing my work, but I decided to reflect upon a great conversation with a dear friend. A bittersweet trait about the work that I do is that it is endless. I am never, truly done with work. 
This is attributed by the fact that my work is in fact, learning, and I absolutely adore it. I love discovering new things and I want to spend my life
doing it. However, I have to admit, sometimes I wish there was some kind of end goal. Whether it is a [grand prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award){:target="_blank"}
or emeritus status, I occassionally fantasize about a grand finale in research. 

What is my purpose in doing research? Is it to learn or be recognized? Do I want to make a positive contribution to society or satisfy my own longings of self-worth?
These questions are important to ask but without careful caution, one may feel hopeless, without purpose, shame, ... N.

Personally, I am in a tight spot because I am genuinely passionate about what I do, but I also enjoy receiving praise and recognition for my work. You may be thinking
'It's not bad to want praise and recognition for your work' but there is a very thin line between doing research for the purpose of learning and doing it for fame.
I admit that I hop back and forth between this thin line. I want my research in computer science to benefit humankind but at the same time, receiving a MacArthur Fellowship wouldn't be half bad. 
I want to become a great professor where I can positively change the trajectories of students' lives and being handed the 'Best Faculy Award' for it would be absolutely fabulous. 

I think about these kinds of things and it challenges my philosophy and theology. I am a Christian and with that I am called to serve and love others. However, a crucial part in this task
is one's heart. Do I truly desire to serve another for the sake of loving them or deep down, do I really want someone to scratch my back when it comes in time. 

I strive for greatness but am humbled by faith. I thank you for your time. Bye.
