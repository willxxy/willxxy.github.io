## Disease 

In this blog, I will reflect upon pages 45-62 from John Mark Comer's **The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry**

Actually, let me backtrack and project this thought that has been lingering ever since I picked this book up. I see many merits to this book so far and I've taken away many principles to live by. However, a cynical question lurked around the corner: Is hurry all that bad? 

We would all like to live in a world where everything is peaceful and spaced out, such that hurry has no place in it. But this is not rational. I mentioned in a previous blog that there are a fair amount of hurries in our lives that are unavoidable. Why does Comer care so much about this topic of hurry? He seems to hold an adamant perspective that hurry is a very scary problem widely prevalent in our society. 

While these thoughts were in my head, I read through the designated chapter for the day and in the first couple paragraphs, he describes the state of hurry as pathological. A disease. And when I read this, I was taken back. The exact sequence of thoughts that ran through my head were:

'Woooah there buddy. Okay, now this guy is just milking the topic.'

to

'Hmmm, is it actually *THAT* serious? 

to

'Wait, this might be something serious.'

Comer lays out the symptoms of the 'hurry' disease and wow, I inhabited many of them. He clarifies that the symptoms are not there to chastise, guilt-trip, or shame anyone but to create a ground framework in which he can intuitively claim just how serious this state of hurry is. One of the examples that he gave was, 'if you count the number of cars in front of you in traffic and often switch lanes to ones that have less amount of cars in them, you probably suffer somewhat from this diease of hurry.' I am not the type to self-diagnose, but I couldn't help realize just how much of a hurried person I was. I try to get as many things done throughout the day, whether they are productive or not. If I am not able to complete the mental checklist I create for each day, I feel unproductive and ashamed. Physically, I am just constantly tired because I haven't been getting much sleep these days. I rarely make time to spend with God and when I do, I am in a hurry. 

Life is short, and if we don't pull our heads up from the chaos from time to time, it'll go by even quicker. Things that are worthwhile in this life all come with patience. Friendships take time to develop and solidify. Love takes time to transform our hearts. Pain takes time to heal. I want to soak in the light of God and the life He has given me. Everyday is a new day. A new day to spend quality time with Him and my loved ones around me.
