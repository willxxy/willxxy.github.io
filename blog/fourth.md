## The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry by John Mark Comer - 1

In this blog, I will reflect on the first 28 pages of John Mark Comer's *The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry.*

In John Ortberg's foreword, he notes a friend's thought on hurry. 

*Hurry involves excessive haste or a state of urgency. It is associated with words such as hurl, hurdle, hurly-burly (meaning 'uproar), and hurricane.
It is a state of frantic effort one falls into in response to inadequacy, fear, and guilt.*
 
The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines hurry as 'disturbed or disorderly activity,' 'to carry or cause to go with haste, 'to impel to rash or precipitate action.'

While I was reading the first couple sections, I thought that the author was very blunt, yet practical. Comer begins with a biographical background, alongside his own struggles
with hurry. As a head pastor at a megachurch for over ten years, Comer has had his fair share of busyness. 6 out of 7 days of the week, his schedule is filled with
back to back activities, with little to no time for himself, his relationship with his family, and most importantly, his relationship with God. 

This really hit home for me. To be honest, ever since I got out of high school, I felt a suffocating amount of pressure and hurry. While I was at community college,
I was in a hurry to transfer. After I transferred to UCI, I was frantically trying to make new connections and 'uncover my passion.' The last 9 to 10 months has been the most busy
time of my life. I finished off my internship at Mosaic Laboratories while self-teaching myself programming. I was constantly interviewing for a full time job after university in conjunction with 
taking on multiple projects, research positions, and most recently, another internship.

I feel overwhelmingly burnt out, but at the same time, energized, motivated, and passionate. Thankfully, God has provided me something that I truly love doing and I am eternally grateful.

In parallel, I never feel truly satisfied with what I am doing. I have more than enough on my plate, but I am always looking for the next thing to do (currently, it is taking the GRE and get into graduate school).
What strikes me is that my relationship with my family and friends has never been better. My relationship with God can always be better, but I can wholeheartedly proclaim that I am an adopted, beloved child of God. 

While I was reading this autobiographical section of the book, I felt a sense of closeness. God is sending me on a wonderful journey in learning the value of patience and slowing down. 
I also want to emphasize that this problem of hurry is pathological and urgent. I can see it's damage to not only my life but the people's lives around me as well. 

We live in the fastest moment in history. Everything is at the tip of our fingers. I've recently heard of same-day delivery by Amazon. Wow! Amazing. Living fast and dying young is certainly
the motto of the 21st century. Live for the present, the now, because if you don't, you might miss it. These kinds of pillars are what drives our economy and ultimately, our lives.

I understand that there are moments in life that hurry is necessary and unavoidable. However, those moments are rare. I want to slow down my life and escape the aura of hurry. I want to slow my life down
and be what I was made to be: a child of God. It is so easy to get swept up and carried away by the fast pace of our world, but hopefully, with this book and God, I want to learn how to walk again. 

Thank you for reading this first reflection, and I hope to see you again!
