## Correlations Between Thinking and Advancement in Technologies

**Prompt:

As people rely more and more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate. 


**Response:

Let us first define the phrase "think for themselves" by deriving contextual information from the prompt. 
The prompt implies that technologies have some kind of ability to "think" and solve problems in place of humans, therefore minimizing the humans' ability and opportunity to think for themselves.
We can then assume that thinking for oneself in this context involves a form of critical self-reflection and calculation done by humans that technologies are capable of deteriorating or replacing. 


Upholding these assumptions, the escalating trend of humans depending on technologies does not correlate with the decrease of one's ability to think for themselves.
I view technologies as a mere catalyst with an optimization objective function which can be formulated in this generic form:

$$min_x f_i(x),$$ 
where $x \in {\rm I\!R}^n$ and $(i = 1, 2, ..., N)$,
subject to 
$$h_j(x) = 0, (j = 1, 2, ..., K)$$
$$g_k(x) \leq 0, (k = 1, 2, ..., T)$$
where $f_i(x)$, $h_j(x)$, and $g_k(x)$ are functions of the vector
$$x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)^T$$

Technologies have efficiently optimized apportionately or fully in tasks such as information extraction, communication, and labor intensive actions (i.e. a crane lifting a huge metal bar).
If we go back a little further in time, inventions such as lightbulbs optimized the sequence of actions in creating a source of energy that emits light. 
As humans have developed more and more of these catalysts for optimiztaion, it leaves us with more time to think about other subjects.
For example, since we have GPS navigation to automatically search and output the quickest route, we no longer have to spend any time in formulating an accurate guide  to our location of interest. 
Does this absence of formulation replace or deteriorate one's ability to think for themselves? 
I would disagree because we seem to replace these forumations that are needed with others. 
Instead of worrying about whether we have an accurate map to our destination, we now replaced this worry with a pondering of which Spotify playlist to play during the drive.
Therefore, technologies are mere support systems for humans to use that optimizes many daily tasks but does not have the capability to deteriorate or replace one's ability to think for themselves.
