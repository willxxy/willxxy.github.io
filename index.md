## About Me

Hi there! I am a 4th year undergraduate at the University of California, Irvine majoring in Psychological Science BA. I am on track to graduate in June 2022! I recently uncovered a deep love for academics, therefore I am studying a breadth of subjects, including but not limited to: Machine Learning, Mathematics, Pathology, Philosophy and AMO Physics. I have been especially fascinated in [multimodal learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTLz0-WCKX616TjsrgPr2wFzKF54y-ZKc){:target="_blank"}, [computer vision for medical imaging](https://github.com/peterchang77/dl_tutor/tree/master/cs190){:target="_blank"}, [autonomous vehicles](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot){:target="_blank"}, [algorithmic topolgy](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/edelcomp.pdf){:target="_blank"}, [analysis and design of algorithms](https://www.edx.org/course/algorithms-design-and-analysis){:target="_blank"}, and [computational game theory](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEGCF-WLh2RJBqmxvZ0_ie-mleCFhi2N4){:target="_blank"}. 

Most of my time these days is being spent at [CMU's Safe AI Lab (SAIL)](https://safeai-lab.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. 

In my free time I like to hang out with my [friends](https://www.instagram.com/wearchives/){:target="_blank"}, [read](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/996/996-h/996-h.htm){:target="_blank"}, [learn chinese](https://www.duolingo.com/learn){:target="_blank"}, practice [coding](https://www.hackerrank.com/){:target="_blank"}, watch [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmHmlXrWdU){:target="_blank"}, and play [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/){:target="_blank"}. 

I also love talking to people so please do not hesitate to reach out to wjhan{at}uci{dot}edu.
