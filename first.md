## First Blog

Hello World. 

I am embarking on my first publicly available blog post. I was inspired to transfer my thoughts to this virtual space such that people may read it and leave

of my social life. My unfiltered contemplations are continuous on an anonymous blog post that will never be traced back to me. 

With that said, I want to begin this first post by greeting you, the reader. Hello. Hi. It is nice to meet you. I am glad you are here. I want you to know
