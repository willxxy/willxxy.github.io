## First Blog

Hello World. 

I am embarking on my first publicly available blog post. I was inspired to transfer my thoughts to this virtual space such that people may read it and leave
with a new thought. Due to the nature of the internet and my own perceptions of it, I will apply a thin layer of censorship essential for the longevity and harmony 
of my social life. My unfiltered contemplations are continuous on an anonymous blog post that will never be traced back to me. I want to make known that 
there will be NaN revisions performed for these posts in hopes to see my freestyle writing progress. 

With that said, I want to begin this first post by greeting you, the reader. Hello. Hi. It is nice to meet you. I am glad you are here. I want you to know
that you are loved. Love. Love is a wonderful subject to explore in my first online post.

The heart is universally known as the symbol of love. But this symbol is contrastive to the one that is shown above.
Out of curiosity, I searched up how the '<3' symbol came to be. According to History.com, the known theory stems from a plant, called silphium, that grew on the North African coastline and was used for contraception. The plant's seedlings looks like this:

Intersting isn't it? I find it absolutely mind boggling how things, such as this presented symbol of love, can be derived N number of times and eventually 
evolve into the state that it is in today. It is important to note that in this particular sample, the derivation is not at all far off from its origin.
However, a contrasting example of an exponential derivation is something like the theory of evolution popularized by Charles Darwin.

Assuming the theory of evolution is true, we can all uniformly marvel at the asymptotic growth of humanity. We have come a long way from single celled
organisms my friends. Occasionally thinking about first principles of existence can be a humbling and mature experience. 

This is all to say that, similar to love, life's depth is limitless. Every piece of knowledge acquired has come from a snowball of history and 
existence. We are who we are today due to what has come before. I want to take this blog post to acknowledge this fact and strive for a greater appreciation for the present. I also want to end by thanking you. Thank you for reading this and thank you for being you. 

Well, See Ya!
